# Angular and Firebase: 📐🔥

## Angular

> AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.

Angular is an amazing front-end framework for building more dynamic web applications. In this workshop, we will be guiding you on how to build web apps with Angular and Firebase! 

## Firebase

Firebase is a tool that allows you to build scalable and manageable applications through backend services that will make hosting, data storage, performance, analytics, testing, and distribution so much easier!
